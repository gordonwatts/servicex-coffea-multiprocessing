# servicex-coffea-multiprocessing

 Some example notebooks and code connecting the three technologies as an experiment

## Install

The library can be installed from this Git repository with all its dependencies in your virtual environment with

```
python -m pip install .
```

If you are developing the library, want to use it directly in jupyter, etc., it is recommended to install in `editable` mode and with the 'complete' extra

```
python -m pip install -e .[complete]
```

## Running

### Prerequisites

1. A valid `.servicex` file that contains a `xAOD` token in it.
2. A valid `funcx` account for the `funcx` demo notebook

## Running the notebooks

Each notebook, as long as started in the environment built by installed `requirements.txt` should work just fine - just execute all the cells.
